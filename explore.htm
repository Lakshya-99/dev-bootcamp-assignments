<p title="Overview of New Vishwanath Temple">
The New Vishwanath Temple is every pious man's go-to destination to feel overwhelmed by the presence and power of the great Lord Shiva. 
Not only is it located in the heart of the cultural capital of India - Varanasi, but its divinity is multiplied by the holy river Ganga that flows by its side. 
Banaras Hindu University is hence home to one of the biggest tourist attractions in the city of Varanasi, the grand New Vishwanath Temple. 
Visiting this temple gives the worshipper the space to put himself in the hands of God, at his disposition, and listen to the voice in his heart. 
The peace and calm of the temple help you forget the distractions of daily life. The positive aura in the air compels one to surrender himself 
in the gentle caress of the Almighty. The very famous Jyotirlinga of Shiva, Vishweshwara, is believed to have immense and unending power. 
A single glance of this Jyotirlinga has the ability to cleanse our soul and set us on the true path of knowledge and devotion. 
Although primarily a Lord Shiva temple, this beautiful temple consists of nine other temples within one and invites people of every faith to bask in its grandeur; 
using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. The New Vishwanath Temple incorporates every element of the Hindu cosmos- the good, 
the evil and the human; thus implying the major role that Dharma, Kama, Artha, Moksa and Karma play in our life.

<p title="About Lord Shiva">
<img src="shiv.jpg" style="float:left;" width=28%>
Shiva is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the Supreme Being within Shaivism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism.
Shiva is the "destroyer of evil and the transformer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. In Shaivism tradition, 
Shiva is the Supreme being who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the goddess tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, 
the goddess is described as supreme, yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and Brahma. A goddess is stated to be the energy and creative power (Shakti) of each, 
with Parvati the equal complementary partner of Shiva. He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.
According to the Shaivism sect, the highest form of Shiva is formless, limitless, transcendent and unchanging absolute Brahman, 
and the primal Atman (soul, self) of the universe. Shiva has many benevolent and fearsome depictions. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as 
an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash as well as a householder with wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. 
In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva, regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and arts.
The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, 
the third eye on his forehead, the trishula as his weapon and the damaru. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of Lingam. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, 
revered widely by Hindus, in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
